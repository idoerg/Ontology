Data.py: added restriciton on edge types that may be used to generate
ancestors. 

get_ancestors and therefore _get_reachable uses, by default, only "is_a"
and "part_of" as edges through which to propagate for ancesotrs.

OboIO.py: added "alt_id". Now the GO alt_id can be used as a key to get
the GO node.
